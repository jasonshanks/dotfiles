# dotfiles...a neverending story by Jason Shanks

dotfiles. What self-respecting nerd wouldn't maintaining their own repo of this right?

These are mine in an ever evolving state, take from it what you will.

## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles ‚Äî say, "Java" ‚Äî you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## what's inside

A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser
above and see what components may mesh up with you.
[Fork it](https://github.com/jasonshanks/dotfiles/fork), remove what you don't
use, and build on what you do use.

## components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- **topic/install.sh**: Any file named `install.sh` is executed when you run `script/install`. To avoid being loaded automatically, its extension is `.sh`, not `.zsh`.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any file ending in `*.symlink` gets symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.

`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS
defaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from
time to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find
this script in `bin/`.

## üôèThanks and üì£shoutouts!

Thanks really to the entire open source and github community who graciously shares their own dotfiles and ways of doing things. So many avenues and options.

Special thanks to:

- [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) - for the inspiration to organise by thematical folders and to include a bootstrap script to auto copy and symlink everything needed to configure a new system. Zach also has still [timeless article](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/) around his methodology and thinking. His were designed around zsh shell, so I have adapted for my preferred shell ‚Äì üêüfish.
- [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) - recursively, much of the script foundation Zach based on Ryan Bates' dotfiles.
